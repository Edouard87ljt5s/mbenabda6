STM32F030F4/Firmware/

Source code distributed under GPLV3 except the font file and startup_stm32f030.s

font is converted from:

"More Perfect DOS VGA and Less Perfect DOS VGA are both free for all use, 
commercial and non-commercial. IBM designed the glyphs and Zeh Fernando did 
most of the work converting them to TrueType, so I don't claim ownership of 
anything."

Matrix Clock Demo:
This is a Matrix style Clock running in VGA 640x480 Text mode 
using the schematic in the hardware section.

Source code is a bit rough and out of date with the development branch as this 
is a quick demo for the VGA Text code.
